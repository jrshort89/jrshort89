### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­  I am currently contributing to open source work!

ðŸ¤”  Iâ€™m looking for help with breaking into the open-source community in a meaningful way.

ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything educational in the coding realm. Maybe I should make a podcast as well... 

âš¡  Fun fact: I am an avid Starcraft 2 fan.
